# Jupyter Notebooks

The .ipynb file contains the Jupyter Notebook which Greg made to present some aspects of it.

If you click on the .ipynb file, github will render the notebook almost so that it looks almost the same way as if you had opened it using Jupyter itself.

To generate a Jupyter notebook, do the following:

1. install Jupyter, e.g. via Python's package manager `pip`:
	
	pip install jupyter

2. start a Jupyter session via the command line

	jupyter notebook

 This will open a session in your web browser. On the right hand side, you should see a button saying "new" --> use it to start your first notebook which will be saved as an .ipynb file.
